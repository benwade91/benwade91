I'm a software engineer who enjoys learning new things daily. I enjoy creating and working with React.JS & JavaScript. I currently work as a garbage man in San Francisco CA, which I've been doing for 7 years. While not at work, I can be found in front of the computer, making my daily commit and earning that little green square, or on the jiujitsu mats. I'm looking to make a career pivot, so feel free to reach out for an open position.
